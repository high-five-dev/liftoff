## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

### 1. Create a project

If you already have PHP and Composer running on your host machine, you can run the following command
```shell
composer create-project high-five/liftoff {PROJECT NAME} --ignore-platform-reqs
```

If you'd rather not set up PHP, you can create the project with a desposable Docker image ([Thanks nystudio107](https://nystudio107.com/blog/dock-life-using-docker-for-all-the-things)).

```shell
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/app -v ${COMPOSER_HOME:-$HOME/.composer}:/tmp composer create-project high-five/liftoff {PROJECT NAME} --ignore-platform-reqs
```

### 2. Start and install

Move into your project folder and run the following commands

```shell
make start
make install
```

### 3. Launch

Run `make launch` to open the project in your browser
